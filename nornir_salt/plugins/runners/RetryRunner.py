RetryRunner plugin
##################

RetryRunner plugin implements retry logic to improve task execution reliability.

Primary usecase for RetryRunner is to make Nornir task execution as reliable as possible
utilizing queuing, retries, connections splaying and exponential backoff mechanisms.

RetryRunner Architecture
========================

RetryRunner helps to control the rate of connections establishment by limiting the number of
connector workers.

For example, if ``num_connectors`` is 5, meaning at any point in time there are only 5 workers
establishing connections to devices, even if there are 100 devices, RetryRunner will connect
only with 5 of them at a time. This is very helpful when connections rate need to be limited
due to operations restrictions like AAA (TACACS, RADIUS) servers load.

When new task started and if no connection exist to device that this task makes the use of,
RetryRunner attempts to connect to device retrying up to ``connect_retry`` times.

Once connection established, task handed over to worker threads for execution, workers
will retry the task up to ``task_retry`` times if task fails.

Connection parameters such as timeouts or usage of SSH keys handled by Nornir Connection plugins.
RetryRunner calls Nornir to start the connection, further connection establishment details
controlled by Connection plugin itself.

Sample Usage
============

Instruct Nornir to use RetryRunner on instantiation and run your tasks::

    from nornir import InitNornir

    NornirObj = InitNornir(
        runner={
            "plugin": "RetryRunner",
            "options": {
                "num_workers": 100,
                "num_connectors": 10,
                "connect_retry": 3,
                "connect_backoff": 1000,
                "connect_splay": 100,
                "task_retry": 3,
                "task_backoff": 1000,
                "task_splay": 100
            }
        }
    )

Connections handling
====================

.. warning::  For parent or grouped tasks need to explicitly provide connection plugin
    ``connection_name`` task parameter such as ``netmiko, napalm, scrapli, scrapli_netconf``,
    etc. Specifying ``connection_name`` attribute for parent or grouped tasks not required if that
    task has ``CONNECTION_NAME`` global variable defined within it. Lack of ``connection_name``
    attribute will result in skipping connections retry logic, jumphost connection logic or credentials
    retry logic and connections to all hosts initiated simultaneously up to the number of ``num_workers``
    option.

Above restriction stems from the fact that Nornir tasks does not have built-in way to communicate
the set of connection plugins that task will use. By convention, task may contain ``CONNECTION_NAME``
global parameter to identify the name(s) of connection plugin(s) task uses.

``CONNECTION_NAME`` global parameter can be a single connection name or a comma separated list of
connection plugin names that task and its subtask uses. RetryRunner honors this parameter and tries
to establish all specified connections before starting the task.

Alternatively, inline task parameter ``connection_name`` can be provided on task run.

However, only parent/main/grouped task supports task parameters, subtasks does not support them.
As a result, if subtask uses connection plugin different from specified in parent task ``connection_name``
parameter or ``CONNECTION_NAME`` variable, subtask connection does not handled by RetryRunner
connections establishment logic and connection established on subtask start simultaneously in parallel
up to the number of ``num_workers`` option.

Sample task that uses different connection plugins for subtasks::

    from nornir.core.task import Result, Task
    from nornir_scrapli.tasks import netconf_get_config
    from nornir_scrapli.tasks import send_command as scrapli_send_command
    from nornir_netmiko.tasks import netmiko_send_command

    # inform RetryRunner to establish these connections
    CONNECTION_NAME = "scrapli_netconf, netmiko, scrapli"

    def task(task: Task) -> Result:

        task.run(
            name="Pull Configuration Using Scrapli Netconf",
            task=netconf_get_config,
            source="running"
        )

        task.run(
            name="Pull Configuration using Netmiko",
            task=netmiko_send_command,
            command_string="show run",
            enable=True
        )

        task.run(
            name="Pull Configuration using Scrapli",
            task=scrapli_send_command,
            command="show run"
        )

        return Result(host=task.host)


RetryRunner task parameters
===========================

RetryRunner supports a number of task parameters to influence its behavior on a per-task
basis. These parameters can be supplied to the task as key/value arguments to override
RetryRunner options supplied on Nornir object instantiation.

RetryRunner task parameters description:

* ``run_connect_retry`` - number of connection attempts
* ``run_task_retry`` - number of attempts to run task
* ``run_creds_retry`` - list of connection credentials and parameters to retry while connecting to device
* ``run_num_workers`` - number of threads for tasks execution
* ``run_num_connectors`` - number of threads for device connections
* ``run_reconnect_on_fail`` - if True, re-establish connection on task failure
* ``run_task_stop_errors`` - list of glob patterns to stop retrying if seen in task exception string
* ``connection_name`` - name of connection plugin to use to initiate connection to device

.. note:: Tasks retry count is the smallest of ``run_connect_retry`` and ``run_task_retry`` counters,
    i.e. ``task_retry`` set to ``min(run_connect_retry, run_task_retry)`` value.

.. warning:: only main/parent tasks support RetryRunner task parameters, subtasks does not support them.

Sample code to use RetryRunner task parameters::

    import yaml
    from nornir import InitNornir
    from nornir.core.task import Result, Task
    from nornir_netmiko import netmiko_send_command

    inventory_data = '''
    hosts:
      R1:
        hostname: 192.168.1.151
        platform: ios
        groups: [lab]

    groups:
      lab:
        username: foo
        password: bar

    defaults:
      data:
        credentials:
          local_creds:
            username: nornir
            password: nornir
          dev_creds:
            username: devops
            password: foobar
    '''

    inventory_dict = yaml.safe_load(inventory_data)

    NornirObj = InitNornir(
        runner={
            "plugin": "RetryRunner"
        },
        inventory={
            "plugin": "DictInventory",
            "options": {
                "hosts": inventory_dict["hosts"],
                "groups": inventory_dict["groups"],
                "defaults": inventory_dict.get("defaults", {})
            }
        },
    )

    # run task without retrying - simulate QueueRunner behavior
    result1 = NornirObj.run(
        task=netmiko_send_command,
        command_string="show clock",
        run_connect_retry=0,
        run_task_retry=0,
    )

    # run task one by one - simulate SerialRunner behavior but with retrying
    result2 = NornirObj.run(
        task=netmiko_send_command,
        command_string="show clock",
        run_num_workers=1,
        run_num_connectors=1,
    )

    # retry credentials if login fails but without retrying conection establishment
    result3 = NornirObj.run(
        task=netmiko_send_command,
        command_string="show clock",
        run_retry_creds=["local_creds", "dev_creds"]
        run_connect_retry=0,
    )

Connecting to hosts behind jumphost
===================================

RetryRunner implements logic to connect with hosts behind bastion/jumphosts.

To connect to devices behind jumphost, need to define jumphost parameters in host's inventory data::

    hosts:
      R1:
        hostname: 192.168.1.151
        platform: ios
        username: test
        password: test
        data:
          jumphost:
            hostname: 10.1.1.1
            port: 22
            password: jump_host_password
            username: jump_host_user

.. note:: Only Netmiko ``connection_name="netmiko"`` and Ncclient ``connection_name="ncclient"``
    tasks, support connecting to hosts behind Jumphosts using above inventory data.

Retrying different credentials
==============================

RetryRunner is capable of trying several credentials while connecting to device.
Credentials tried in a sequence starting with host's inventory username and
password parameters moving on to connection parameters supplied in ``creds_retry``
RetryRunner option.

Credentials retry logic implemented using ``conn_open`` task plugin in a way that
``creds_retry`` list content passed as ``reconnect`` argument to ``conn_open`` task.

Items of ``creds_retry`` list tried sequentially until connection successfully established,
or list runs out of items. If no connection established after all ``creds_retry`` items tried,
this connection attempt considered unsuccessful, hosts queued back to connectors queue and
process repeats on next try.

Sample inventory with retry credentials::

    hosts:
      R1:
        hostname: 192.168.1.151
        platform: ios
        groups: [lab]
        data:
          credentials:
            local_creds:
              username: admin
              password: admin

    groups:
      lab:
        username: foo
        password: bar

    defaults:
      data:
        credentials:
          local_creds:
            username: nornir
            password: nornir
            extras:
              optional_args:
                key_file: False
          dev_creds:
            username: devops
            password: foobar

``credentials`` defined within ``default`` data section, but can be defined
inside host or groups data. Credentials definitions does not merged across
different data sections but searched in a ``host -> groups -> defaults`` order
and first one encountered used.

Sample code to use ``creds_retry``::

    from nornir import InitNornir

    NornirObj = InitNornir(
        runner={
            "plugin": "RetryRunner",
            "options": {
                "creds_retry": ["local_creds", "dev_creds"]
            }
        }
    )

``creds_retry`` items parameters used as Nornir ``host.open_connection`` kwargs,
as a result all arguments of
`open_connection <https://nornir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/nornir/core/inventory.html#nornir.core.inventory.Host.open_connection>`_
method are supported such as ``username``, ``password``, ``port``, ``extras`` etc.
